<h1> <strong> Title </strong> : A Machine Learning Powered Movie Recommendation System  </h1>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> 
Machine Learning (ML) a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables systems to learn from data and make predictions. With the rapid growth of the entertainment industry, users often face difficulty in finding content aligned with their interests. <br>
To solve this, a movie recommendation system is designed using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering and hybrid methods. Collaborative filtering suggests movies based on similar user preferences, while content-based filtering uses metadata like genre, cast, and director to recommend related titles. <br>
Techniques such as text vectorization and cosine similarity are applied to assess the similarity between movies. Users input a favorite movie and the system generates personalized suggestions by comparing it with the dataset.
This solution offers a scalable and accurate way to enhance user experience through intelligent recommendations powered by ML.</p>
